                            Most of the publications were derived from 'Chromatin Papers ListServe' maintained by Bone J.

                            Cyanobacteria like Synechocystis sp. can be used as model organism as they undergo both oxidative respiration and photosythesis.
                            Cyanobacteria have many features common to bacteria including a lack of compartmentalisation. This dataset is used to gather articles
                            showing interactions relevant to plant photosynthesis, redox metabolism, resistance to metal and oxidative stress.
                            Most interactors belong to Cyanobacteria species, with a focus on Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803), TaxID 1148,
                            but some interactors belong to species where biological events seen in Cyanobacteria may also occurs like
                            plants for photosynthesis. Also, the dataset contains a number of hybrid experiments using electron transfer
                            between proteins from different species.

                            The Alliance of Cellular Signalling (AFCS) consisted of around 20 institutions which were engaged in a collaborative effort to investigate

                            The AfCS used high-throughput methods to detect protein-protein interactions between signaling molecules expressed in B
                            cells and cardiac myocytes. The AfCS arranged a collaboration with Myriad Genetics to perform large-scale yeast two-hybrid

                    <li>Mutation (MI:0118): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event. <em>This root term is used when there is a mutation present in a protein and the wild type version has not been tested or shown to interact in the referenced paper.</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mutation causing an interaction (MI:2227): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event that enables an interaction when compared with the wild-type, which does not interact.</li>
                            <li>Mutation decreasing interaction (MI:0119): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion decreases significantly interaction strength or rate (in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction).
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mutation decreasing interaction rate (MI:1130): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion decreases significantly interaction rate (in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction).</li>
                                    <li>Mutation decreasing interaction strength (MI:1133): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion decreases significantly interaction strength.</li>
                                    <li>Mutation disrupting interaction (MI:0573): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion totally disrupts an interaction strength or rate (in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction).<br />
                                        â¢ Mutation disrupting interaction rate (MI:1129): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion totally disrupts an interaction rate (in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction).<br />
                                        â¢ Mutation disrupting interaction strength (MI:1128): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion totally disrupts an interaction strength.<br />
                                    </li>
                                </ul></li>
                            <li>Mutation increasing interaction (MI:0382): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion increases significantly interaction strength or rate (in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction).
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mutation increasing interaction rate (MI:1131): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion increases significantly interaction rate (in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction).</li>
                                    <li>Mutation increasing interaction strength (MI:1132): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion increases significantly interaction strength.</li>
                                </ul></li>
                            <li>Mutation with no effect (MI:2226): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event that does not have any effect over an interaction when compared with the wild-type.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Output format description</h3>
                <p>We provide a tab-delimited flatfile download with the full dataset. Every instance of a mutation affecting a given interaction is given a unique identifier (<em>âFeature ACâ</em>). Please notice that some mutations will affect more than one residue position range in non-consecutive order. Each one of these non-consecutive ranges is recorded in a separate line, hence there will always be a difference between the number of lines in the file and the number of unique mutations. Here is a brief description of the different columns used in the file:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feature AC: Accession number for that particular mutation feature.</li>
                    <li>Feature short label: Human-readable short label summarizing the amino acid changes and their positions, compliant with the Human Genome Variation Society recommentadiotns (see <a href="http://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/protein/" class="uri">http://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/protein/</a>) .</li>
                    <li>Feature range(s): Position(s) in the protein sequence affected by the mutation.</li>
                    <li>Original sequence: Wild type amino acid residue(s) affected, in one letter code.</li>
                    <li>Resulting sequence: Replacement sequence (or deletion) in one letter code.</li>
                    <li>Feature type: Mutation type, following the PSI-MI controlled vocabularies as stated above.</li>
                    <li>Feature annotation: Specific comments about the feature that can be of interest.</li>
                    <li>Affected protein AC: Affected protein identifier (preferably UniProtKB accession, if available).</li>
                    <li>Affected protein symbol: As given by UniProtKB.</li>
                    <li>Affected protein full name: As given by UniProtKB.</li>
                    <li>Affected protein organism: TaxID and species name as given by UniProtKB.</li>
                    <li>Interaction participants: Identifiers for all participants in the affected interaction, along with their species and molecule type between brackets.</li>
                    <li>PubMedID: Reference to the publication where the interaction evidence was reported.</li>
                    <li>Figure legend: Reference to the specific figures in the paper where the interaction evidence was reported.</li>
                    <li>Interaction AC: Interaction accession within our databases. This can be used to obtain further information about the interaction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Further columns will be added once the dataset is enriched with cross-references to other databases such as UniProt and Ensembl.</p>
